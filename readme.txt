**S3bubble Backup Plug-in:**
At S3bubble we know that backing up your site is important, as problems are just around the corner.
Sites can get hacked, you could accidentally delete something vital, and crashes happen more often than you think.
But with the S3bubble Backup Plug-in, you can rest assured that your Wordpress site can be easily recovered. 

**Backing Up:**
We are a complete WordPress solution for database backup operations. You can create backups of your WordPress database, where they will be restored using phpMyAdmin, cPanel or can be used for easy migration.
The S3bubble Backup also allows you to run full backups, or create on the spot backups for safekeeping.

**Installing:**
You install this plugin through the S3bubble service by logging into your account and selecting the ‘create new application’ option.
You’ll need two keys to set up your plugin, and will have to enter the names of the buckets you wanted linked to the S3bubble backup plugin. You can add all of your buckets, or individual ones.
 
**Scheduling:**
With our plug-in you can schedule your backups to happen automatically. You can set up Backups to happen hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly on preset hours. Or you could also set up for single backups to take place on a preset date.
Old backups are easily removed, so you can maintain a clutter free backup folder.
 
**Amazon S3:**
If your site has gone down, you won’t want your backups to be stored on that server as well. This is why we use an offsite storage destination like Amazon S3.
Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.
By storing your site backups here, S3bubble ensures that your database backups are always accessible to you, wherever you are.
 
**Email:**
The S3bubble Backup Plug-in also includes a function that sends users a notification when a a new back up is ready and allows the backup archive to be sent via email, enacting a high standard of safekeeping.

**Compression:**  
works by finding similar strings within a text file, and replacing those strings temporarily to make the overall file size smaller. This form of compression is particularly well-suited for the web because text files, such as .sql, usually contain plenty of repeated strings, such as whitespace, tags, and style definitions.

**Types of backups:**
Database-  This type of backup can be run daily, on a schedule set by you. Our analytics tell you how big the backup will be, if the plugin can access it, what time it will be backed up at, and if your site host can handle it. 
Once the instant backup is completed, you can easily sort through previous files by filtering by time in the backup storage. You will also be informed of whether this file has been saved to S3bubble, or locally on your computer. If the backup has not been saved to your S3bubble account, you will be given the option to upload it easily, then can delete the local file to avoid clutter.
All of the files from this backup type are listed by date and time and stored in S3bubble so they are always there for you to utilise.

File- This type  of backup stores all the files you need for your webpage, zips them all and uploads them. 
Our plugin analytics will tell you how long it took to carry out this task, and stores the backedup files both locally and in the cloud waiting for you to either download or save to S3bubble.


**Security:** 
By having two keys required for the setup process and allowing the user to choose which buckets are linked to the the plugin means that if a hacker did manage to get access, not all of the buckets of that user will be affected. 
Also, the user has the control to revoke the app completely if the plugin was compromised in any way.
